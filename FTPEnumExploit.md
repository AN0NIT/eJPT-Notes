# FTP Enum Exploit
- [Reference Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdgBU9MDAwE&t=25234s)

- Check for anonymous login on the FTP server.
- Sometimes u might have to gather credentials from others sources like SMB shares, to change the attack inorder to proceed.
- So if we get any sort of credentials remember to run them through various services.

- If anonymous login is allowed, check if the files in that directory is accessible in the webserver, through directory traversal.

- If a message is put in the directory of the FTP server saying, the files in the FTP directory will be checked/executed manually, then just add a reverse shell payload and wait for a shell.

- Always remember to set the transfer to "binary" before putting or getting files off of the FTP server as it might fail some exploits while trying to put the exploit file into the server.
